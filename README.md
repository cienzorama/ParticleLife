# Particle Life simulation

Particle Life it's a particle system simulation that shows complex emerging behaviors from very simple interaction rules between particles, like attraction and repulsion at certain distances.

## Some features:
- Implemented using JavaScript and p5.js.
- The accelerations are computed using space partitioning algorithm.
- Leap-Frog numerical integrator.
- Periodic boundary conditions.
- Rules change randomly every 300 frames.
- Simple representation of interaction rules.
- For now, particle type are fixed in 6 and particle number is 1500. In future updates these parameters will be modified during the simulation.
